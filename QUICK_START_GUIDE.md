## 🧪 Creating a Test User (If You Don't Have Credentials)

### Option 1: Use Registration Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:5174/register`
2. Fill in:
   - Email
   - Password
   - Company Name
3. Submit
4. **Issue**: Email verification is required
   - You need Supabase email configured OR
   - Local Supabase running with Inbucket

### Option 2: Direct Database Insert (Recommended for Testing)
If you have access to your Supabase database:

```sql
-- 1. Create a tenant
INSERT INTO public.tenants (company_name, business_type, plan_name)
VALUES ('Test Company', 'IT Staffing', 'FREE')
RETURNING tenant_id;

-- 2. Create auth user (via Supabase Dashboard or SQL)
-- Then create profile:
INSERT INTO public.profiles (user_id, tenant_id, email, role, status)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_AUTH_USER_ID',
  'TENANT_ID_FROM_STEP_1',
  'test@example.com',
  'ADMIN',
  'ACTIVE'
);

-- 3. Create a subscription
INSERT INTO public.subscriptions (tenant_id, plan_name, status)
VALUES ('TENANT_ID_FROM_STEP_1', 'CRM', 'ACTIVE');
```

## 🎯 What Works Right Now (Frontend Only)

### ✅ Fully Functional:
- All navigation and routing
- All forms and validations
- Search and filter UI
- Modal interactions
- Multi-select and autocomplete
- Tabs and accordions

- Responsive layout

### ⏳ Mock Data (Waiting for Backend):
- Contact list (2 sample contacts)
- Reference table data (pre-populated with realistic values)
- Email templates (2 samples)
- Notifications (2 samples)
- Statistics/charts (sample numbers)

### 🔌 Ready for Integration:
All components have `// TODO: Replace with actual API call` comments where API integration is needed.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **No Backend Yet**: All data is in-memory (refreshing browser loses data)
2. **File Upload**: Needs Supabase Storage configuration
3. **Email Sending**: Needs Resend API key + edge function deployment
4. **User Management**: Team lead/recruiter dropdowns need employees table
5. **Persistence**: Need to apply migrations and deploy functions
