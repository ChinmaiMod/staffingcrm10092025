## Best Practices

### Team Structure Recommendations

1. **Keep Teams Focused**
   - Create teams based on specialization (IT, Healthcare, etc.)
   - Or by region (East Coast, West Coast, etc.)
   - Or by client type (Enterprise, SMB, etc.)

2. **Assign Clear Leads**
   - Each team should have at least one Lead
   - Leads should have manageable team sizes (5-10 recruiters)

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Update team descriptions as responsibilities change
   - Remove inactive members promptly
   - Deactivate teams instead of deleting when no longer needed

### Naming Conventions

Good team names:
‚úÖ "IT Staffing - West Coast"
‚úÖ "Healthcare RN Recruiters"
‚úÖ "Enterprise Sales Team A"

Avoid:
‚ùå "Team 1"
‚ùå "John's Team"
‚ùå "Temp"
