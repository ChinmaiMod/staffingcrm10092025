        ↓
AdvancedFilterBuilder Displays
        ↓
User Builds Filter Configuration
        ↓
User Clicks "Apply Filter"
        ↓
handleApplyAdvancedFilters(config)
        ↓
setAdvancedFilterConfig(config)
setIsAdvancedFilterActive(true)
        ↓
finalContacts = applyAdvancedFilters(filteredContacts, config)
        ↓
Table Re-renders with Filtered Results
        ↓

```

### Filter Configuration Structure

```javascript
{
  groups: [
    {
      id: 1,
      conditions: [
        {
          id: 1,
          field: "visa_status",
          operator: "equals",
          value: "H1B"
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          field: "job_title",
          operator: "contains",
          value: "Java"
        }
      ],
      logicalOperator: "AND"  // Conditions within group
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      conditions: [
        {
          id: 1,
          field: "years_experience",
          operator: "is",
          value: "5-7"
        }
      ],
      logicalOperator: "AND"
    }
  ],
  groupLogicalOperator: "OR"  // Between groups
}
```

**Interpretation**: 
(visa_status = "H1B" AND job_title contains "Java") OR (years_experience = "5-7")

---

## 📊 Use Case Coverage

The advanced filtering feature supports all requested use cases:

### ✅ Use Case 1: Name + Pipeline
**Request**: "Candidate whose name starts with 'Aa' and is from recruitment pipeline"

**Filter**:
```
Group 1:
  - first_name starts_with "Aa"
  AND
  - status is "Assigned to Recruiter" OR "Recruiter started marketing"
```

### ✅ Use Case 2: Tech Stack + Experience + Visa
**Request**: "Candidate in recruitment pipeline from Java background and 5+ years of experience and H1B status"

**Filter**:
```
Group 1:
  - status is "Assigned to Recruiter"
  AND
  - job_title contains "Java"
  AND
  - years_experience is "5-7" OR "7-9" OR "10-15" OR "15+"
  AND
  - visa_status equals "H1B"
```

### Additional Common Use Cases

1. **Ready-to-Market Candidates**: Status = "Resume prepared" OR "Assigned to Recruiter"
2. **Healthcare in Specific States**: contact_type = "healthcare_candidate" AND (state = "CA" OR "TX" OR "NY")
3. **Senior Developers**: years_experience = "10-15" OR "15+"

- **Enter Value**: Text input or dropdown based on field type
- **Add Condition**: "+" button to add more conditions to group
- **Add Group**: "+" button to create new group
- **Remove Condition**: "✕" button on each condition
- **Remove Group**: "✕" button on each group (if more than one)

## ⚡ Performance

### Current Implementation: Client-Side Filtering

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Instant results (no network latency)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ No server load

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Fast for < 1,000 contacts
- Acceptable for < 5,000 contacts
- May need optimization for > 10,000 contacts

### Future: Server-Side Filtering

The `buildSupabaseQuery()` function is already implemented and ready for use when needed:

```javascript
const query = buildSupabaseQuery(supabase.from('contacts'), filterConfig)
const { data, error } = await query
```

**When to Switch**:
- Contact count > 10,000
- User reports slow filtering
- Need pagination with filters
