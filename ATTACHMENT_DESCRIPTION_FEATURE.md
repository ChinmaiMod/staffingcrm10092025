## Database Schema

The `contact_attachments` table includes a `description` field:

CREATE TABLE contact_attachments (
  attachment_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_id uuid REFERENCES contacts(contact_id),
  storage_path text NOT NULL,
  file_name text,
  description text, -- NEW: Description/note for the attachment
  content_type text,
  size_bytes bigint,
  uploaded_by uuid,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Usage

### When Creating/Editing a Contact

1. **Upload Files**
   - Click "Choose Files" button
   - Select one or more files

2. **Add Descriptions**
   - Each file shows an input field below it
   - Enter a description like "Resume" or "Cover Letter"
   - Description helps identify the file's purpose

3. **Save Contact**
   - Descriptions are saved with the attachments
   - Can be viewed later in contact details

### Example Workflow

**Uploading Multiple Documents:**
```
File: john_doe_resume_2025.pdf
Description: "Current Resume - Updated Jan 2025"

File: cover_letter.docx  
Description: "Cover Letter for Java Developer Position"

File: certifications.pdf
Description: "AWS and Azure Certifications"

File: linkedin_profile.pdf
Description: "LinkedIn Profile Export"
```

### In Contact Detail View

When viewing a contact's attachments:
- File name is displayed prominently
- Description appears in italics below the file name
- Upload date shows at the bottom
- Easy to identify each file's purpose at a glance

## Benefits

### For Recruiters
- ✅ **Quick Identification**: Know what each file contains without opening it
- ✅ **Version Tracking**: Track different versions ("Resume v1", "Resume v2")
- ✅ **Organization**: Categorize documents clearly
- ✅ **Time Saving**: Find the right document faster

### For Candidates (Future)
- ✅ **Clarity**: Know what documents they've submitted
- ✅ **Completeness**: Ensure all required docs are uploaded
- ✅ **Updates**: Easy to see which files need updating

## Best Practices

### Recommended Description Format

**For Resumes:**
- "Resume - [Month Year]"
- "Resume - [Position Name]"
- "Updated Resume - [Date]"

**For Other Documents:**
- "Cover Letter - [Position/Company]"
- "Portfolio - [Type of Work]"
- "Certificate - [Certification Name]"
- "Reference Letter - [From Whom]"
- "Transcript - [Degree/Institution]"

### Examples

✅ **Good Descriptions:**
- "Resume - Java Developer - Jan 2025"
- "Cover Letter - Google Application"
- "AWS Solutions Architect Certificate"
- "Reference Letter - Previous Manager"
- "Bachelor's Transcript - MIT"

❌ **Poor Descriptions:**
- "doc1"
- "file"
- "resume" (too generic if multiple versions)
- (blank)

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (ContactForm.jsx)

```javascript
// Attachment object structure
{
  file: File,
  name: "resume.pdf",
  size: 1048576,
  type: "application/pdf",
  description: "Resume - Updated Jan 2025", // NEW
  preview: "blob:..." // for images
}

// Handler for description changes
const handleAttachmentDescriptionChange = (index, description) => {
  setAttachments(prev => {
    const updated = [...prev]
    updated[index].description = description
    return updated
  })
}
```

### Backend (When Implemented)

```javascript
// When uploading to Supabase Storage
for (const attachment of attachments) {
  const formData = new FormData()
  formData.append('file', attachment.file)
  formData.append('contact_id', newContact.contact_id)
  formData.append('description', attachment.description || '') // Include description
  await uploadContactAttachment(formData)
}

// Saved to database
await supabase
  .from('contact_attachments')
  .insert({
    contact_id: contactId,
    storage_path: storagePath,
    file_name: fileName,
    description: description, // Stored in database
    content_type: contentType,
    size_bytes: fileSize
  })
```

### Display in Contact Detail

```jsx
{attachment.description && (
  <div style={{ 
    fontSize: '12px', 
    color: '#475569', 
    marginTop: '6px',
    fontStyle: 'italic',
    padding: '4px 8px',
    background: '#f1f5f9',
    borderRadius: '4px'
  }}>
    {attachment.description}
  </div>
)}
```
