### Database Changes:

#### Tables Created:
1. **teams** table
   - 10 columns: team_id, tenant_id, business_id, team_name, description, is_active, created_by, updated_by, created_at, updated_at
   - Primary Key: team_id (UUID)
   - Foreign Keys: tenant_id → tenants, business_id → businesses

   - Foreign Keys: team_id → teams, staff_id → internal_staff, assigned_by → profiles
   - CHECK Constraint: role IN ('LEAD', 'RECRUITER')
   - Unique Constraint: (team_id, staff_id)

#### RLS Policies Applied:
**Teams (5 policies):**
- ✅ SELECT: Users can view teams in their tenant

- ✅ DELETE: Users can delete team members in their tenant
- ✅ ALL: Service role has full access to team members

#### Indexes Created:
1. `idx_unique_team_name_per_tenant` - Unique (tenant_id, business_id, LOWER(team_name))
2. `idx_teams_tenant_id` - teams(tenant_id)
3. `idx_teams_business_id` - teams(business_id)
4. `idx_teams_is_active` - teams(is_active)
5. `idx_team_members_team_id` - team_members(team_id)
6. `idx_team_members_staff_id` - team_members(staff_id)
