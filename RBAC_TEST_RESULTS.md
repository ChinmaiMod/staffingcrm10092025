## Next Steps for Manual Testing

### 1. Create Test Users (Via Supabase Auth)
- [ ] CEO user: `ceo@test.com`
- [ ] Manager user: `manager@test.com`
- [ ] Lead user: `lead@test.com`
- [ ] Recruiter user: `recruiter@test.com`
- [ ] Read-Only user: `readonly@test.com`

### 2. Assign Roles (Via SQL)
Use SQL scripts in `RBAC_TESTING_GUIDE.md` Section "Part 2: Manual User Testing"

### 3. Create User Hierarchy
Set up reporting structure: CEO → Manager → Lead → Recruiter

### 4. Create Test Data
- Create 2-3 businesses
- Create 1 pipeline with 5 stages
- Create 4-5 contacts (1 per user)

### 5. Application Testing
- [ ] Login as each user
- [ ] Verify menu visibility
- [ ] Test contact CRUD operations
- [ ] Test pipeline management
- [ ] Test user management
- [ ] Test role assignment

### 6. Security Testing
- [ ] Attempt unauthorized access
- [ ] Attempt privilege escalation
- [ ] Verify RLS enforcement
- [ ] Check audit logs

---

## Known Limitations

### Schema Compatibility
**Issue**: Mixed ID types (bigint vs uuid)
- `contacts.created_by` is bigint (references old users table)
- `profiles.id` is uuid (references auth.users)

**Impact**: Fine-grained ownership checks (own vs subordinate vs all) cannot be fully enforced at RLS level

**Mitigation**: 
- RLS enforces role-level permissions (create, view, edit, delete flags)
- Application layer must enforce ownership-based filtering
- Helper functions provided for app-layer checks

### Performance Considerations
- Complex RLS policies may impact query performance on large datasets
- Recommend adding indexes on commonly filtered columns (created_by, tenant_id, etc.)
- Monitor slow queries and optimize as needed

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Create test users via Supabase Auth dashboard
2. ✅ Assign roles using SQL scripts
3. ✅ Test application with different roles
4. ✅ Verify menu visibility and CRUD operations
5. ✅ Document any issues found

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add indexes on role_id, user_id, tenant_id columns
- [ ] Implement row-level caching for permission checks
- [ ] Add audit logging for role assignments
- [ ] Create UI for role management (UserRolesManagement.jsx)
- [ ] Create UI for role assignment (AssignUserRoles.jsx)
- [ ] Add permission checking React hooks
- [ ] Implement menu filtering based on permissions

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring for RLS queries
- [ ] Monitor audit logs for permission violations
- [ ] Track role assignment changes
- [ ] Alert on failed permission checks
