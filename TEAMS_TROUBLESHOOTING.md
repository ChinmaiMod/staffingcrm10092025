# Testing Teams Feature - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Failed to load available staff"

This error occurs when:
1. The browser is using cached JavaScript (old version)
2. There are no internal staff members in the database
3. The tenant_id filtering is preventing access

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
**Clear browser cache to load new code:**

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"
- OR just press `Ctrl + F5` to hard refresh

**Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cache"
- Click "Clear Now"
- OR press `Ctrl + F5`

### Step 2: Check Internal Staff Table

The Teams feature requires internal staff members to exist. Navigate to:
- **Data Administration ‚Üí Internal Staff**

You should see at least one staff member listed there.

#### If No Staff Exists:

**Option A: Add via UI**
1. Go to Data Administration ‚Üí Internal Staff
2. Click "Add Internal Staff"
3. Fill in:
   - First Name: John
   - Last Name: Doe
   - Email: john.doe@company.com
   - Position: Recruiter
   - Status: Active
4. Click "Save"

**Option B: Add via SQL (if you have Supabase access)**
```sql
-- Replace YOUR_TENANT_ID with your actual tenant_id
INSERT INTO internal_staff (
  tenant_id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  position,
  status,
  is_active,
  hire_date,
  created_at,
  updated_at
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_TENANT_ID',
  'John',
  'Doe',
  'john.doe@company.com',
  'Recruiter',
  'ACTIVE',
  true,
  CURRENT_DATE,
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

### Step 3: Verify RLS Policies

Make sure Row Level Security allows you to see internal staff:

1. Check your profile has the correct tenant_id
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Check browser console for any RLS errors

**Open Browser Console:**
- Press `F12`
- Go to "Console" tab
- Look for any red error messages
- Share screenshot if errors appear

### Step 4: Test the Fix

After hard refresh:

1. Navigate to **Teams** page: `/crm/data-admin/teams`
2. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ Inline form at top (gray box)
   - ‚úÖ Team Name field + Business dropdown + "+ Add Team" button
   - ‚úÖ Description field below
3. Create a test team
4. Click "üë• Members" on the team
5. Click "+ Add Team Member"
6. **Staff dropdown should now show names** (not "Select Staff Member")
7. Select a staff member and role
8. Click "Add Member"

### Step 5: If Still Not Working

**Check these:**

1. **Is dev server running?**
   - You should see Vite running in terminal
   - URL: http://localhost:5173

2. **Did you pull latest code from Git?**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Are there any console errors?**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

4. **Is the database accessible?**
   - Try viewing other pages (Contacts, Businesses)
   - If those work, it's specific to Teams/Staff

### Step 6: Debugging Queries

If staff still doesn't load, check the browser console for the actual query:

**Look for:**
```
Error loading staff: [error message here]
```

**Common errors:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Failed to load available staff" | No tenant_id or no data | Add internal staff members |
| "permission denied" | RLS policy issue | Check you're logged in correctly |
| "relation does not exist" | Table not created | Run migration 025_internal_staff_schema.sql |
| "column does not exist" | Schema mismatch | Check migration applied correctly |
