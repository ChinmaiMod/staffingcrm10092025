## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yvcsxadahzrxuptcgtkg/sql/new

2. Copy and paste the entire contents of:
   `supabase/migrations/010_pipelines_schema.sql`

3. Click **"Run"**

4. Wait for success message

**Also apply the registration fix (if not already done):**
```sql
-- From 009_fix_registration_rls.sql
CREATE POLICY "tenants_insert_own" ON tenants
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);

CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_own" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Pipeline

1. **Navigate to:** Data Administration
2. **Click:** Pipelines card (🔄)
3. **Click:** "+ Create Pipeline"
4. **Fill in:**
   - Name: "Recruitment Pipeline"
   - Description: "Main candidate recruitment process"

   - ✅ Set as default pipeline
5. **Click:** "Create"

### Step 3: Add Stages

-- Get IDs first
SELECT pipeline_id, name FROM pipelines;
SELECT stage_id, name FROM pipeline_stages WHERE pipeline_id = 'YOUR_PIPELINE_ID';
SELECT contact_id, first_name, last_name FROM contacts LIMIT 10;

-- Assign contact to pipeline
INSERT INTO contact_pipeline_assignments (
  contact_id,
  pipeline_id,
  stage_id,
  assigned_by
) VALUES (
  'CONTACT_ID_HERE',
  'PIPELINE_ID_HERE',
  'FIRST_STAGE_ID_HERE',
  auth.uid()
);
```

### Step 5: Use Pipeline View

## 📈 Analytics & Insights (Available via SQL)

### Pipeline Conversion Rates
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name as pipeline_name,
  ps.name as stage_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cpa.contact_id) as contact_count,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - cpa.last_stage_change))/86400) as avg_days_in_stage
FROM pipelines p
JOIN pipeline_stages ps ON ps.pipeline_id = p.pipeline_id
LEFT JOIN contact_pipeline_assignments cpa ON cpa.stage_id = ps.stage_id
GROUP BY p.name, ps.name, ps.display_order
ORDER BY p.name, ps.display_order;
```

### Stage History Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as contact_name,
  ps_from.name as from_stage,
  ps_to.name as to_stage,
  psh.changed_at,
  prof.email as changed_by
FROM pipeline_stage_history psh
JOIN contact_pipeline_assignments cpa ON cpa.assignment_id = psh.assignment_id
JOIN contacts c ON c.contact_id = cpa.contact_id
LEFT JOIN pipeline_stages ps_from ON ps_from.stage_id = psh.from_stage_id
JOIN pipeline_stages ps_to ON ps_to.stage_id = psh.to_stage_id
JOIN profiles prof ON prof.id = psh.changed_by
ORDER BY psh.changed_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Not Showing in Dropdown

**Problem:** Created pipeline but not visible in Pipeline View

**Solutions:**
1. Check `is_active = true` in database
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Check RLS policies allow viewing
4. Verify tenant_id matches your profile

### Can't Drag Contacts

**Problem:** Drag-and-drop not working

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure contact is assigned to the pipeline
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
4. Verify `contact_pipeline_assignments` record exists

### Stage History Not Recording

**Problem:** History table empty after stage changes

**Solutions:**
1. Check trigger is installed: `track_stage_change_trigger`
2. Verify RLS policy allows INSERT on history table
3. Check trigger function exists: `track_pipeline_stage_change()`

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** "Permission denied" when creating pipeline

**Solutions:**
1. Verify user role is `tenant_admin` or `ADMIN`
2. Check RLS policies on pipelines table
3. Confirm tenant_id matches user's tenant
