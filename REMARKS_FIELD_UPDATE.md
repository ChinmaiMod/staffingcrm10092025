# Contact Form - Remarks Field Update

## Change Summary

### Issue
User requested that Remarks/Comments field should not be mandatory in Contacts form.

### Analysis
Upon inspection, the Remarks field was **already optional**:
- ✅ No `required` attribute on the textarea HTML element
- ✅ Not validated in the `validateForm()` function
- ✅ Can be left empty when saving a contact

### Enhancement Made
Updated the label and placeholder text to make it clearer that the field is optional:

**Before:**
```jsx
<label>Remarks / Comments</label>
<textarea
  placeholder="Add any additional notes..."
/>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<label>Remarks / Comments (Optional)</label>
<textarea
  placeholder="Add any additional notes or comments (optional)..."
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Clearer UX**: Users can immediately see that this field is optional
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No need to guess if the field is required
3. **Better Guidance**: Updated placeholder provides more context

## Required Fields in Contact Form

The following fields ARE required and validated:
- ✅ First Name (2-50 characters, letters/spaces only)
- ✅ Last Name (2-50 characters, letters/spaces only)
- ✅ Email (valid email format)
- ✅ Contact Type (must select from dropdown)

The following fields are OPTIONAL:
- Phone (validated only if provided)
- City (validated only if provided)
- **Remarks/Comments** (no validation)
- All other dropdown fields

## File Modified
- `src/components/CRM/Contacts/ContactForm.jsx`

## Testing
1. Navigate to CRM → Contacts → + Add Contact
2. Fill in only required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Contact Type)
3. Leave Remarks/Comments empty
4. Save contact
5. ✅ Contact should save successfully without requiring remarks

## Status
✅ **Complete** - No code changes needed for functionality (already optional)  
✅ **Enhanced** - Updated label and placeholder for better UX
