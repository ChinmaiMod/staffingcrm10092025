## Database Schema

### Teams Table
```
team_id          UUID (PK)
tenant_id        UUID (FK) - Multi-tenant isolation
business_id      UUID (FK) - Optional business scoping
team_name        TEXT - Unique per tenant/business (case-insensitive)
description      TEXT
is_active        BOOLEAN
created_by       UUID
updated_by       UUID
created_at       TIMESTAMP
updated_at       TIMESTAMP
```

### Team Members Table
```
member_id        UUID (PK)
team_id          UUID (FK) - Links to teams
staff_id         UUID (FK) - Links to internal_staff
role             TEXT - 'LEAD' or 'RECRUITER' (enforced)
assigned_at      TIMESTAMP
assigned_by      UUID
is_active        BOOLEAN

UNIQUE(team_id, staff_id) - Prevents duplicates
```

## Security

- ‚úÖ Full Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ‚úÖ Tenant isolation - users only see their tenant's teams
- ‚úÖ Cascade deletion - removing a team removes all members
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity
- ‚úÖ CHECK constraint enforces valid roles

## Next Steps

1. **Test both features thoroughly**
2. **Create sample data** - Add a few teams and assign members
3. **Verify filtering** - Test business-specific vs global teams
4. **Test edge cases** - Try duplicate names, duplicate members
5. **Performance check** - Verify queries are fast with RLS

## Troubleshooting

### If Teams page doesn't load:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify migration was applied successfully
- Ensure you're logged in with valid tenant

### If dropdowns don't populate:
- Check that countries/states/cities tables have data
- Verify RLS policies allow reading these tables
- Check browser network tab for failed requests

### If you can't add team members:
- Ensure internal_staff table has active records
- Verify the staff member isn't already on the team
- Check for tenant_id mismatch
