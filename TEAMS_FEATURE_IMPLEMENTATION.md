# Teams Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Teams Management system with Lead/Recruiter hierarchy and cascading location dropdowns for contacts.

## 1. Database Schema (Migration 020)

### Tables Created

#### `teams` Table
- `team_id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `tenant_id` (UUID, FK to tenants) - Multi-tenant isolation
- `business_id` (UUID, FK to businesses, Optional) - Business scoping
- `team_name` (TEXT) - Team name with unique constraint per tenant/business
- `description` (TEXT, Optional)
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN, Default: true)
- Audit fields: `created_by`, `updated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Key Features:**
- Unique index on `(tenant_id, business_id, LOWER(team_name))` for case-insensitive uniqueness
- CASCADE DELETE when tenant/business is deleted
- Full RLS policies for tenant isolation

#### `team_members` Table
- `member_id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `team_id` (UUID, FK to teams) - CASCADE DELETE
- `staff_id` (UUID, FK to internal_staff) - CASCADE DELETE
- `role` (TEXT) - CHECK constraint: 'LEAD' or 'RECRUITER'
- `assigned_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- `assigned_by` (UUID, FK to profiles)
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN, Default: true)

**Key Features:**
- UNIQUE constraint on `(team_id, staff_id)` prevents duplicate assignments
- CHECK constraint enforces only 'LEAD' or 'RECRUITER' roles
- Full RLS policies for tenant-scoped access

### Indexes Created
1. `idx_teams_tenant_id` - Fast tenant filtering
2. `idx_teams_business_id` - Business filtering
3. `idx_teams_is_active` - Active team queries
4. `idx_team_members_team_id` - Member lookups by team
5. `idx_team_members_staff_id` - Team lookups by staff
6. `idx_team_members_role` - Role-based queries
7. `idx_unique_team_name_per_tenant` - Unique team names (case-insensitive)

### RLS Policies
**10 policies total (5 per table):**
- SELECT: Users can view teams/members in their tenant
- INSERT: Authenticated users can create teams/add members in their tenant
- UPDATE: Users can modify teams/members in their tenant
- DELETE: Users can remove teams/members in their tenant
- Service Role: Full access for backend operations

## 3. Routing Updates

### DataAdministration.jsx Changes

**Added:**
```jsx
import TeamsPage from './Teams/TeamsPage'

const REFERENCE_TABLES = [
  // ... existing tables
  { id: 'teams', label: 'Teams', icon: 'ü§ù', path: 'teams' },
]

<Routes>
  {/* ... existing routes */}
  <Route path="teams" element={<TeamsPage />} />
</Routes>
```

**Navigation:**
- Teams card appears in Data Administration grid
- Clicking "Teams" navigates to `/crm/data-admin/teams`
- Dedicated route for full team management UI

## 4. Cascading Location Dropdowns

### ContactForm.jsx Modifications

**Database Integration:**
- Replaced hardcoded `COUNTRIES`, `USA_STATES`, `INDIA_STATES` arrays
- Added dynamic loading from `countries`, `states`, `cities` tables

**New State Variables:**
```jsx
const [countries, setCountries] = useState([])
const [availableStates, setAvailableStates] = useState([])
const [availableCities, setAvailableCities] = useState([])
const [loadingStates, setLoadingStates] = useState(false)
const [loadingCities, setLoadingCities] = useState(false)
```

**New Functions:**
```jsx
loadCountries() // Fetch all countries on mount
loadStates(countryName) // Fetch states for selected country
loadCities(stateName) // Fetch cities for selected state
```

**Cascading Logic:**
1. Country selection ‚Üí Load states ‚Üí Reset state/city fields
2. State selection ‚Üí Load cities ‚Üí Reset city field
3. Disabled state/city dropdowns until parent selected

**UI Changes:**
- Country: `<select>` with dynamic countries array
- State: `<AutocompleteSelect>` with disabled prop
- City: `<AutocompleteSelect>` with disabled prop

### AutocompleteSelect.jsx Enhancement

**Added `disabled` Prop:**
```jsx
disabled = false // Default value
```

**Disabled Behavior:**
- Prevents dropdown opening
- Disables all user interactions
- Visual feedback: Gray background, reduced opacity, "not-allowed" cursor
- Applied to input, select option, focus, and blur handlers

**Styling When Disabled:**
```jsx
backgroundColor: '#f3f4f6'
cursor: 'not-allowed'
opacity: 0.6
```

## 5. Migration Applied

## 8. Key Benefits

### Teams Feature
1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear Lead/Recruiter roles
2. **Flexible Assignment**: Teams can be business-specific or global
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Enforces unique team names and staff assignments
4. **Audit Trail**: Tracks who created/assigned members and when
5. **Tenant Isolation**: Full RLS ensures multi-tenant security
6. **Cascade Deletion**: Removing teams automatically removes members

### Cascading Dropdowns
1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures valid country/state/city combinations
2. **Better UX**: Progressive disclosure prevents invalid selections
3. **Database-Driven**: Centralized data management via reference tables
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new countries/states/cities via Data Admin
5. **Performance**: Indexed lookups for fast queries
6. **Validation**: Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity

## 9. Technical Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Security
